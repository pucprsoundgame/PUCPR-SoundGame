# PUCPR SOUND GAME (PSG) DOWNLOAD PAGE
Welcome to PSG download page. From this page is possible to download the [Windows version](https://github.com/pucprsoundgame/PUCPR-SoundGame/raw/master/Builds/Windows/PSG.zip) of the game or [play it online](https://pucprsoundgame.netlify.com).

## Instructions
- Download [the Windows version](https://github.com/pucprsoundgame/PUCPR-SoundGame/raw/master/Builds/Windows/PSG.zip) and unzip it.
- Locate the **Sons** (Sounds) folder in folder´s hierarchy. Inside "Sons" folder is possible to find **SFX** and **Musicas** (Music) folder. Newer version will bring folders translated to english.
- Folders **SFX** and **Musicas** already have files (with silence only) only available to help the user to know the exact name of each one. For instance: "sfx_jump.ogg" must be replaced by user´s version of a jump sound, keeping this exact name.
- Same reasoning should be applied to the **Musicas** folder.
- **All** sounds **must** have **OGG** format.
